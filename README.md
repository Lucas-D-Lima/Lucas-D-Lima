### A little about myself
I started 'programming' with 12 to create a bot for my discord server, but it didn't work out very well since I didn't know much, I later migrated to JS, but because of procrastination it doesn't evolve much, however, incredibly I can create some programs with a lot of effort, and no, I don't know how to center div in css without using google, just like you
